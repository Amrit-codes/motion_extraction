# motion_extraction
A simple bash script to extract motion from videos using [ffmpeg](https://github.com/FFmpeg/FFmpeg)

## Dependencies
A bash terminal and [ffmpeg](https://github.com/FFmpeg/FFmpeg)

## How it works
First the script take the video and inverts it.
Then the inverted video is overlaid over the original one with some delay
The lower the delay the more minute details are visible and vice versa

### Credits
I got the original idea from [Pospy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSS6yAMZF78&t=234s)
Do check out his YouTube channel, he does some really cool stuff
